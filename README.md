The [Terms of Use](https://everybody.codes/legal) don't allow to publish the test-data.

Therefore my own input data will not be commited.

## Development Tools

This repository contains a small CLI script to scaffold new quests.

renames files and placeholders, and installs dependencies automatically.

### Usage

From the repository root, run:

```bash
npm run create-quest
